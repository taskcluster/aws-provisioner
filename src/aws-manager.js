 *
 *   1. We want to have exceptions that always have region, method and service
 *      name if available
 *   2. Any requests which would have a requestId should include it in their

 *   3. Sometimes promises from AWS-SDK just magically never return and never

 *   4. Useful logging that includes useful debugging information
 *   5. Because we're catching the exceptions here, there's a *chance* that
 *      we might get useful stack traces.  AWS-SDK exceptions which aren't
 *      caught seem to have the most utterly useless stacks, which only
 *      have frames in their own state machine and never include the call

/**
 * The AWS Manager is an object which tracks the state of the EC2 nodes,
 * pricing and other aspects of interfacing with AWS's ec2 api.  Instances of
 * this defer to responses of the EC2 API where appropriate.  There are cases
 * where state sometimes needs to be maintained inside of the AWS Manager
 * itself.  This is related to the evenutally consistent design of the EC2 api.
 *
 * Key to understanding how this class works is understanding the different
 * states defined:
 *
 * running:
 *      These are instances which are doing work.  They are booted, they are
 *      configured and they have requested their provisioner secrets.
 * pending:
 *      These are fulfilled spot requests which are either in the process of
 *      being booted up or are doing their internal setup.  They have not yet
 *      fetched their provisioner secrets
 * requested:
 *      These are spot requests which have been made but have not yet been
 *      fulfilled by amazon and so are not even machines yet
 * internallyTracked:
 *      These are spot instances which have been made but have not yet shown up
 *      in the EC2 describeSpotRequests method.  The reason for this is that
 *      the EC2 API is eventually consistant.  We've seen requets live in this
 *      state for 20+ minutes sometimes, and even turn into running instances
 *      before the api returns them in the describe* api calls.  We track these
 *      ourselves because if we didn't, we could get into a state of constantly
 *      submitting requests, forgetting about those requests then over
 *      provisioning.
 *
 * Where possible, objects from the EC2 API are kept in as close shape and
 * meaning to the EC2 api.  This is done to make it easier to reason with the
 * objects and to allow for comparison to the EC2 API docs.
 *
 * Constructor arguments:
 * ec2:
 *      This is a object which maps EC2 regions (e.g. us-west-1) to instances
 *      of the aws-sdk-promise library for the corresponding region.
 * provisionerId:
 *      This is the id of this provisioner (e.g. aws-provisioner-v1').  This
 *      value is passed through to the Queue verbatim and is used to find the
 *      number of pending tasks for a given provisionerId/workerType combo
 * keyPrefix:
 *      We use a prefix on KeyPair.Name for a given instance to store metadata.
 *      The EC2 api provides for metadata to be stored in Tags, but tags are
 *      not able to be set at the time a spot request is requested.  We use
 *      this as a workaround.  This is currently the name of the worker type
 *      the instances/request is associated with as well as a hash of the ssh
 *      KeyPair key material so that we can upgrade ssh keys.
 * pubKey:
 *      public key data to be stored as the KeyPair data.  We use a single
 *      public key for all instances.  Ideally in the future we would actually
 *      use a public key that no one has the matching private key for so that
 *      we effectively disable ssh access to our machines.
 * maxInstanceLife:
 *      absolute upper bounds of instance life.  This should never be hit, but
 *      is rather a safety limit to ensure we don't have things living forever.
 * influx:
 *      Instance of a taskcluster-lib-stats.stats.Influx class which is used to
 *      submit data points to an influx instance
 * monitor:
 *      Instance of a taskcluster-lib-stats.monitor which is used to
 *      submit data points to a statsum instance
