  A worker launchSpecification and required metadata
type:                       object
properties:
  workerType:
    type: string
    description: |
      The ID of the workerType
  launchSpecification:
    type: object
    description: |
      AWS LaunchSpecification values shared by all regions and all instance-types.
      This launch spec should not contain either an InstanceType or ImageId.  The
      former should always be a key in the types object and the latter should be
      an overwrite in the regions object
  minCapacity:
    type: number
    description: |
      Minimum number of capacity units to be provisioned.  A capacity unit
      is an abstract unit of capacity, where one capacity unit is roughly
      one task which should be taken off the queue
  maxCapacity:
    type: number
    description: |
      Maximum number of capacity units to be provisioned.
  scalingRatio:
    type: number
    description: |
      A scaling ratio of 1.1 means that we don't start spawning new machines
      until 10% of our capacity is pending.  A scaling ratio of 0.9 means that
      we spawn enough machines that we always have 10% empty capacity.
