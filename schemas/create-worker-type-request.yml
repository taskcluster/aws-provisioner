description: |
  A worker launchSpecification and required metadata
type:                       object
properties:
  launchSpecification:
    type: object
    description: |
      AWS LaunchSpecification values shared by all regions and all instance-types.
      This launch spec should not contain either an InstanceType or ImageId.  The
      former should always be a key in the types object and the latter should be
      an overwrite in the regions object
  minCapacity:
    type: number
    description: |
      Minimum number of capacity units to be provisioned.  A capacity unit
      is an abstract unit of capacity, where one capacity unit is roughly
      one task which should be taken off the queue
  maxCapacity:
    type: number
    description: |
      Maximum number of capacity units to be provisioned.
  scalingRatio:
    type: number
    description: |
      A scaling ratio of 1.1 means that we don't start spawning new machines
      until 10% of our capacity is pending.  A scaling ratio of 0.9 means that
      we spawn enough machines that we always have 10% empty capacity.
  minSpotBid:
    type: number
    description: global minimum spot instance bid
  maxSpotBid:
    type: number
    description: global maximum spot instance bid
  canUseOndemand:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      True if this worker type is allowed on demand instances
  canUseSpot:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      True if this worker type is allowed spot instances
  types:
    type: object
    description: |
      This is a dictionary which contains information about the instance types
      which can be used and how to configure each instance type.
    properties:
      capacity:
        type: number
        description: |
          This number is a count of the abstract number of Capacity Units this
          machine can have.  Capacity units are roughly equivalent to the number
          of pending tasks that this machine can take care of
      utility:
        type: number
        description: |
          This number is an abstract relative measure of performance.  A machine
          with a utility factor of 5 will be picked over a machine that has a
          utility factor of 1 if the price of the more expensive machine is less
          that 5 times that of the cheaper machine.
      overwrites:
        type: object
        description:
          This object contains keys which will overwrite the default AWS Launch
          Specification with values that are unique to this instance type.
      required:
        - capacity
        - utility
        - overwrites
      additionalProperties: false
  regions:
    type: object
    description: |
      This object contains information which is unique to a specific AWS Region.
      Information in this dictionary takes precedence over per-instance-type keys
    properties:
      overwrites:
        type: object
        description: |
          This object contains keys which will overwrite keys in the default and
          instance-type specialized Launch Specifications.
        properties:
          ImageId:
            type: string
            description: |
              Because AMI IDs (ImageId in the API Objects) are unique to each region
              we force this key to be present
          required:
            - ImageId
additionalProperties: false
required:
  - launchSpecification
  - maxCapacity
  - scalingRatio
  - minSpotBid
  - maxSpotBid
