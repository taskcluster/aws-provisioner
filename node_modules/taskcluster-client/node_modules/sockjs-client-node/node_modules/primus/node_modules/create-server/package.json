  "readme": "# create-server\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/primus/create-server.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/primus/create-server)\n[![NPM version](https://badge.fury.io/js/create-server.svg)](http://badge.fury.io/js/create-server)\n[![Coverage Status](https://img.shields.io/coveralls/primus/create-server.svg)](https://coveralls.io/r/primus/create-server?branch=master)\n\nI've found my self writing this particular piece of snippet over and over again.\nIf you need to have a common API for creating a HTTP, HTTPS or SPDY server this\nmight be the module that you've been waiting for.\n\n## Installation\n\nAdd it to your Node.js project by running\n\n```\nnpm install --save create-server\n```\n\n## Creating a server\n\nIn all code examples we assume that you've required the module and saved it as\nthe `create` variable:\n\n```js\n'use strict';\n\nvar create = require('create-server');\n```\n\nThe `create` variable is now a function which can be used to create different\ntypes of servers. The function accepts 2 different arguments:\n\n1. A number which should be the port number or object with the configuration for\n   the servers.\n2. Optionally, an object with different callback methods.\n\nThe following properties can be configured:\n\n- **port**: The port number we should listen on. Also used to determine which\n  type of server we need to create.\n- **spdy**: Create SPDY server instead of a HTTPS server.\n- **root**: The root folder that contains your HTTPS certs.\n- **key, cert, ca, pfx, crl** Path or array of paths which will be read out the\n  correct files. The path should be relative to the **root** option.\n- **redirect**: Start up an optional HTTP server who will redirect users to the\n  port you're listening on. The supplied value should be the port number we need\n  to listen on.\n- **listen**: Do need to start listening to the server for you?\n\nThe following properties can be provided as callback object:\n\n- **close**: Server is closed.\n- **request**: Received a new incoming request.\n- **upgrade**: Received a HTTP upgrade request.\n- **listening**: We're now listening. Receives an optional error as first\n  argument.\n- **error**: Received a new error on the server.\n- **https**: A new HTTPS server has been created.\n- **http**: A new HTTP server has been created.\n- **spdy**: A new SPDY server has been created.\n\n## License\n\nMIT\n",
